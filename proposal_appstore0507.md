# AppStore Java Web Project team 0507

## Description
In this project, we are going build a web application similar to the Google Play or Apple appstore with the goal of providing users with an easy to navigate page where they can browse available apps. The app store will use the following technologies: JAVA using Spring-MVC[1] framework, Hibernate ORM[2], MySQL[3] (data storage), Tomcat 8.0[4] (web server), and AngularJS[5] (UX).

The major functionalities are fairly simple. App information will be provided in a raw dataset and then loaded into a MySQL database. The final interface will filter the home page to only show the top 10 apps. Finally, if the user wishes to learn more about an app, they will be able to click on an app and be directed to a details page.
